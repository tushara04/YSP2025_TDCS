## The Cult of Pattern

### Difficulty Level: Hard

### Instructions
You have just found a coded ritual pattern in an old manuscript. If you print it exactly for n = 5, it reveals the hidden symbol of an ancient cult.
The pattern looks like:

*       *
 *     * 
  *   *  
   * *   
    *    
   * *   
  *   *  
 *     * 
*       *

**Challenge:**
1. Recreate this by coding using loops.

2. Then, refactor your code into 2 or more functions — because the pattern is symmetrical. Can you figure out the best way to break it up?

> Note: If you don't understand something, look up what it means.
